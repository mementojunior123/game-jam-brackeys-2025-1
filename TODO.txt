Theme: Nothing can go wrong
Game link: https://mementojunior123.itch.io/game-jam-13

The plan:
A mouse(or kbm) based bullet hell game where everything kicks off beacause you did something you shouldn't have.
(Like pressing a big red button)
Every "stage" is you doing something you shouldn't have.
Example: You turn on a broken lawnmower and it starts charging and sending grass at you. New objective: Survive.
The last stage is simple: All you have to do is *not* press the red button.
If you don't press it after 30s, you get the good ending and win (easter egg).
If you *do* press it, then you get an infinite(?) assault where you try to get a high score.


*After all, what could possibly go wrong?*

Priority list

Necessary : These are absolutely necessary for the game to work.
-The bullet hell part
-Figure out how controlling your caracter and how dodging works 
 (Is there a dodge ability? 
 Do we use a mouse or a keyboard?)
-Figure out what exactly causes the stages to start

High : These features will be prioritized during developpement. Ideally, all of them get finished.
-Figure out the theming of each stage
-Add a bit of music and sfx so the game dosent feel empty
-Add *some* assets to the game
-The endgame

Medium : These features will be added if there is spare time at the end of the jam. Some of them may be added.

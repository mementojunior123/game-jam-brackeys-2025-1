The plan:
A mouse(or kbm) based bullet hell game where everything kicks off beacause you did something you shouldn't have.
(Like pressing a big red button)
Every "stage" is you doing something you shouldn't have.
Example: You turn on a broken lawnmower and it starts charging and sending grass at you. New objective: Survive.

*After all, what could possibly go wrong?*

Stage 1: Red button (Introduction)
Stage 2: Lawnmower (Might not be done/replaced due to lack of assets)
Stage 3: Red switch "Patience"
Extra stage: Infinite assault (Difficulty dosent stop going up)
Extra stage 2: Computer virus

Priority list

Necessary : These are absolutely necessary for the game to work.
-The bullet hell part
-Figure out how controlling your caracter and how dodging works 
 (Is there a dodge ability? 
 Do we use a mouse or a keyboard?)
-Figure out what exactly causes the stages to start
-Stage 1

High : These features will be prioritized during developpement. Ideally, all of them get finished.
-Figure out the theming of each stage
-Add a bit of music and sfx so the game dosent feel empty
-Add *some* assets to the game
-Funny dialouge
-Stage 3
-Endless assault


Medium : These features will be added if there is spare time at the end of the jam. Some of them may be added.
-Get proper assets
-Get more diverse sound and music
-Stage 2
-Extra stage 2

Low : These features will not be added in the game jam.
-Implement settings
-Proper mobile support
